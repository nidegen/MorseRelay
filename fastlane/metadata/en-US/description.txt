Morse Relay allows you to:
- Send out morse code over your device's torch
- Record it by pointing your camera at another device that is emitting a morse message.

Currently, it only supports encoding and decoding from app to app. The algorithms do not support human message fully yet.

For device without torch, the signal is emitted in a blinking box on the screen.
